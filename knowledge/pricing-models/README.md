# Vertical AI Agent Pricing Models

> How to price vertical agents for maximum value capture while ensuring customer ROI.

## Pricing Philosophy

**Core principle:** Price on value delivered, not cost to build.

A vertical agent that saves 15 hours/week at $50/hour = $39,000/year in value.
Charging $15,000/year = 2.6x ROI for customer, 95%+ margin for us.

**The SMB pricing sweet spot:** $10K-25K/year
- Low enough: Doesn't require board approval, owner can decide
- High enough: Signals serious tool, not a toy
- Monthly equivalent: $800-2,000/month feels reasonable to business owners

## Pricing Tiers Structure

### Three-Tier Model (Recommended)

| Tier | Price Range | Target Customer | Includes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $10-15K/year | Small SMB, testing | Core features, limited volume |
| **Growth** | $18-30K/year | Established SMB | Full features, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | $40K+/year | Multi-location, complex | Custom integrations, SLA |

### Per-Vertical Calibration

| Vertical | Starter | Growth | Enterprise | Justification |
|----------|---------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Legal (PI Intake) | $12K | $20K | $35K | High hourly value of attorney time |
| Construction (RFQ) | $15K | $25K | $45K | High project values, clear ROI |
| Dental (Scheduling) | $10K | $18K | $30K | Smaller practices, tighter margins |
| HVAC/Plumbing | $12K | $22K | $40K | Dispatch urgency = high value |
| Auto Repair | $10K | $18K | $30K | Volume business, medium margins |
| Insurance | $18K | $35K | $60K | High ACV per policy, compliance needs |
| Real Estate | $12K | $20K | $35K | Commission-based, variable |
| Veterinary | $10K | $18K | $28K | Similar to dental |

## Value Calculation Framework

### Step 1: Quantify Time Savings

```
Hours saved per week: [X]
× Hourly value of that time: $[Y]
× 52 weeks
= Annual time value: $[Z]
```

**Hourly values by role:**
- Owner/Partner: $150-300/hour
- Manager/Estimator: $50-100/hour
- Admin/Coordinator: $25-50/hour

### Step 2: Quantify Revenue Impact

```
Additional capacity enabled: [X] more jobs/clients/projects
× Average value per: $[Y]
× Win rate: [Z]%
= Annual revenue opportunity: $[W]
```

### Step 3: Set Price at 30-50% of Total Value

```
Total annual value = Time savings + Revenue opportunity
Target price = Total value × 0.3 to 0.5
```

**Example: Construction RFQ**
- Time savings: 100 hrs/month × $75 × 12 = $90,000
- Revenue impact: 5 extra bids × $50K × 10% = $25,000
- Total value: $115,000/year
- Price at 20%: $23,000/year ✓

## Add-On Pricing

### Common Add-Ons

| Add-On | Price | Value Prop |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Additional location | $150-300/month | Scale across sites |
| Voice/phone capability | $300-500/month | More channels |
| Custom integrations | $3-10K one-time | Connect their stack |
| White-label/branding | $2-5K one-time | Their brand, our tech |
| Priority support | $200-400/month | Faster response |
| Training session | $500-1K one-time | Team onboarding |

### Setup Fees

| Complexity | Setup Fee | Includes |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | $0-2K | Self-service onboarding |
| Guided | $2-5K | Assisted setup, data migration |
| Custom | $5-15K | Custom integrations, workflows |

## Billing Models

### Annual Prepay (Preferred)
- **Discount:** 10-15% off monthly equivalent
- **Benefit:** Cash flow, commitment, lower churn
- **Typical:** 70% of customers after pilot

### Monthly
- **Use for:** Pilots, risk-averse customers
- **Convert to annual:** After 3 months of success

### Usage-Based Component (Optional)
- Good for: High-volume verticals (RFQs, appointments)
- Structure: Base fee + per-transaction above threshold
- Example: $15K/year + $5 per RFQ after 50/month

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. General Automation Tools (Zapier, Make)
- **Their price:** $50-200/month
- **Our angle:** "Pre-built for your industry, no DIY"
- **Price premium:** 5-10x justified by specialization

### vs. Industry Software Suites
- **Their price:** $300-1,500/month
- **Our angle:** "AI-native, focused on [specific workflow]"
- **Price:** Comparable or slightly lower

### vs. Human Labor
- **Their cost:** $40-80K/year for admin/coordinator
- **Our angle:** "Handles the repetitive work, humans do high-value"
- **Price:** 25-50% of a headcount

## Pilot Pricing

### Standard Pilot Terms
- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Price:** Free or $500 (skin in the game)
- **Scope:** Limited volume, full features
- **Success criteria:** Defined upfront

### Conversion Strategy
```
Pilot → First 90 days at 75% price → Full price
```

This reduces perceived risk while capturing value.

## Price Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "Let's calculate your ROI together. How many hours does [task] take weekly?" |
| "Can't budget this year" | "What if we start with a pilot and bill annually starting Q1?" |
| "Competitor is cheaper" | "They're general-purpose. We're built specifically for [industry]. What's your time worth?" |
| "Need to think about it" | "What information would help you decide? Can I show you a specific use case?" |

## Discounting Guidelines

### When to Discount
- First customer in a new vertical (case study value)
- Multi-year commitment (2-3 years)
- Strategic reference customer
- Competitive win-back

### Max Discount by Tier
| Tier | Max Discount | Requires |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Starter | 15% | Manager approval |
| Growth | 20% | Director approval |
| Enterprise | 25% | VP approval |

### Never Discount
- Monthly customers (convert to annual for discount)
- Ongoing discounts without commitment
- "Just because they asked"

## Revenue Modeling

### Per-Vertical Unit Economics

```
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):
- Average contract: $18K/year
- Average lifespan: 3 years
- LTV: $54K

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
- Sales cycle: 4 weeks
- Sales time: 10 hours @ $100/hour = $1,000
- Marketing cost per customer: $500
- Total CAC: $1,500

LTV:CAC Ratio: 36:1 ✓
```

### Year 1 Target by Vertical

```
10 customers × $15K avg = $150K ARR per vertical
3 verticals = $450K ARR Year 1

Year 2: 30 customers/vertical × 5 verticals = $2.25M ARR
Year 3: 50 customers/vertical × 8 verticals = $6M ARR
```

## Quick Reference Card

**For any new vertical:**

1. Calculate time value: [hours × rate × 52]
2. Calculate revenue impact: [capacity × value × win rate]
3. Price at 30-40% of total
4. Set three tiers: Starter (0.7x), Growth (1x), Enterprise (1.5-2x)
5. Add-ons: locations ($200/mo), voice ($400/mo), custom ($5K)

**Default pricing if unsure:** $15K/year base, $25K/year Growth
